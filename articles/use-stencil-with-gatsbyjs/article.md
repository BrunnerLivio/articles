[Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) is one of my favorite frameworks and _in my opinion_ combines the best of
both the Angular and React worlds. Though not only that! Stencil is *just* a toolchain
for building your Web Components - **that run in every major browser**.

Unfortunately, there is a caveat with Web Components:
They only run with JavaScript and do not work with SSR.

Whilst that is true - if you've built your Web Components library with Stencil, you have are covered by their amazing SSR integration!

Let's have a look at how we were able to run our Design Systems UI library with GatsbyJS! With this article, I won't go into details on how you set up a Stencil project. So make sure you understand the fundamentals of Stencil already.

## Setup the Project

I am going to assume in this article that you have already set up a Stencil project. In my case, this project is called `@my-company/webcomponents`. 

In order to replicate my setup, execute the following commands. We will end up with a simple mono-repository. Though if you want to keep things separated - that would work too!

```bash
# âœ… Create the project folder
mkdir stencil-gatsbyjs
cd stencil-gatsbyjs
npm init -y

# âœ… Setup Git (optional)

mkdir packages
cd packages

# âœ… Setup Stencil
# Select "components"
# Choose name "webcomponents" or whatever name you want
npm init stencil

# âœ… Setup GatsbyJS
# Choose name "docs" or whatever name you want
# "Yes" to everything else
npm init gatsby

# âœ… Setup Lerna (optional)
cd ..
npx lerna init
npx lerna bootstrap
```


My folder structure now looks like this:


```bash
$ tree -I node_modules
.
â”œâ”€â”€ lerna.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ packages
    â”œâ”€â”€ docs

        â”œâ”€â”€ src

        â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ my-component.spec.ts
        â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ my-component.tsx
        â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ readme.md
        â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components.d.ts
        â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
        â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
        â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ utils
        â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ utils.spec.ts
        â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ utils.ts
        â”œâ”€â”€ stencil.config.ts
        â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json

10 directories, 24 files
```


## Enable SSR with Stencil

Once we have set up the fundamental project, let's make sure we have added the [_hydrate app_](https://stenciljs.com/docs/hydrate-app) functionality inside our Stencil project.

The hydrate app is a bundle of your same components but compiled so they can be hydrated on a NodeJS server, and generate HTML.

In order to enable it, simply go to your `stencil.config.ts` file (in our case `packages/webcomponents/stencil.config.ts`) and add the following line inside the `outputTargets`-array.

`packages/webcomponents/stencil.config.ts`
```typescript
{ type: 'dist-hydrate-script' }
```

This will generate a new folder called `hydrate` after running ` npm run build`. We will need to use that folder later!

Don't forget to update your `.gitignore`-file to exclude the `hydrate` folder.

```bash
$ cd packages/webcomponents
$ echo "hydrate" >> .gitignore
```


As well as updating your `package.json`-file.

`packages/webcomponents/package.json`

```diff
- "name": "webcomponents",
+ "name": "@my-company/webcomponents",
  "files": [
    "dist/",
    "loader/",
+   "hydrate/"
  ],
```

As a last step, lets link our library so we can use it locally later.

```bash
$ npm link
# Go back to the project root folder
$ cd ../../
```

## Use your Stencil components with GatsbyJS

With the previous step, we have enabled SSR with Stencil. Basically, we now have access to the `hydrate` folder which exposes the `renderToString` function. This function basically prerenders the web components into plain old HTML which will be hydrated once JavaScript is loaded.

In order to make use of this function, we have to add it into our `gatsby-node.js`.

```bash
$ cd packages/docs
$ touch gatsby-node.js
$ touch gatsby-browser.js

# We are going to use that package later
$ npm install --save glob
```


> The code is inspired by https://github.com/jonearley/gatsby-plugin-stencil. Personally, I prefer this enhanced version, since it allows you to add multiple Stencil packages, as well as provide better error handling. I have created a PR against the repository with the changes, so hopefully you will be able to simply consume this as a Gatsby plugin soon https://github.com/jonearley/gatsby-plugin-stencil/pull/3 (16. May 2021)

`packages/docs/gatsby-node.js`

```javascript
const util = require("util");
const glob = util.promisify(require("glob"));
const fs = require("fs");

const readFile = util.promisify(fs.readFile);
const writeFile = util.promisify(fs.writeFile);

/*
  Server-side render Stencil web components
*/
exports.onPostBuild = async ({ reporter }) => {
  // Make sure to edit the following lines
  const pluginOptions = {
    module: ['@my-company/webcomponents'],
    renderToStringOptions: {},
  }
  
  let packages = pluginOptions.module;
  if (!Array.isArray(pluginOptions.module)) {
    packages = [pluginOptions.module];
  }

  const files = await glob("public/**/*.html", { nodir: true });

  const renderToStringOptions = pluginOptions.renderToStringOptions
    ? pluginOptions.renderToStringOptions
    : {};

  async function preRenderPage(file, hydrate, pkg) {
    try {
      const page = await readFile(file, "utf-8");
      const { html, diagnostics = [] } = await hydrate.renderToString(
        page,
        renderToStringOptions
      );

      diagnostics.forEach((diagnostic) =>
        reporter.error(
          `error pre-rendering file: ${file} with ${pkg}. ${JSON.stringify(
            diagnostic,
            null,
            "  "
          )}`
        )
      );

      await writeFile(file, html);
    } catch (e) {
      reporter.error(
        `error pre-rendering file: ${file} with ${pkg}. ${e.message}`
      );
    }
  }

  async function preRenderPackage(pkg) {
    const hydrate = require(`${pkg}/hydrate`);
    await Promise.all(files.map((file) => preRenderPage(file, hydrate, pkg)));
    reporter.info(`pre-rendered ${pkg}`);
  }

  return Promise.all(packages.map(preRenderPackage));
};
```

In a nutshell, this script will be executed in "post build" (so after the HTML, CSS, and JS files have been generated). We simply go through every HTML file and execute Stencils `renderToString` function and save the contents.

Now we just need to add a few lines to our `gatsby-browser.js`.


`packages/docs/gatsby-browser.js`

```javascript
const { defineCustomElements } = require("@my-company/webcomponents/loader");
defineCustomElements();
```

Now we can start using our web component inside our pages.

`packages/docs/src/pages/index.js`

```diff
const IndexPage = () => {
  return (
    <main style={pageStyles}>
      <title>Home Page</title>
      <h1 style={headingStyles}>
        Congratulations
+       <my-component
+         first="Albus"
+         middle="Percival Wulfric Brian"
+         last="Dumbledore"
+       />
        <br />
```

Done! ðŸŽ‰ 
Let's link our Webcomponents library with the docs and build the site.

```bash
$ npm link @my-company/webcomponents 
$ npm run build
# Start a simple HTTP server on port 8000 from the "public" folder
$ npx servor public index.html 8000

# Open up your site on http://localhost:8000
```

You should now see the following site. Note the _"Hello, World! I'm Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore"_ is being rendered by our Webcomponent! 

![Gatsby website rendering our webcomponent](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/s80zf3nztbqveo7eev2v.png)

## Inspect the output

In order to double-check the SSR we can try disabling JavaScript and the website should render the same. In Chrome, `Open up Dev Tools` -> `CMD + SHIFT + P` or `CTRL + SHIFT + P` -> `Disable JavaScript` -> `Reload the page`.

You still see the _"Hello World! I'm Albus..."_? Great! The Webcomponent still renders with JavaScript disabled.

So what did Stencils `renderToString` actually do. Well, let's have a look at the diff of the built `index.html` file we just generated from the `npm run build`.

As first stricking difference we see in the `<head>`-tag that Stencil has added the CSS of our web component:

```diff
   <head>
     <meta charset="utf-8" />
     <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge" />
@@ -8,6 +8,12 @@
       content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no"
     />
     <meta name="generator" content="Gatsby 3.5.0" />
+    <style sty-id="sc-my-component">
+      /*!@:host*/
+      .sc-my-component-h {
+        display: block;
+      }
+    </style>
```

Also inside the HTML of our Webcomponent has been rendered with the correct text (removed comments and unnecessary attributes for readability).

```diff
<h1 style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 64px; max-width: 320px">Congratulations
      <my-component
        first="Albus"
        middle="Percival Wulfric Brian"
        last="Dumbledore"
-      ></my-component>
+       class="sc-my-component-h hydrated">
+         <div class="sc-my-component">
+           Hello, World! I'm Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore
+         </div>
+       </my-component>
```

So basically the `renderToString` function takes care of the first render - which allows us to use the WebComponents even without JavaScript.
